# Tennis Database Web Application

A comprehensive Flask-based web application for managing tennis league operations, match scheduling, and facility coordination. This full-featured system provides both web and command-line interfaces for USTA league management with sophisticated scheduling algorithms, quality scoring, and conflict detection.

    
    Database Capability:
    
     - generate a unique, deterministic match ID to avoid duplicate scheduling.
     - create functions to schedule (assign matches to facilities) following
       facility constraints, team preferences, then league preferences.
    
    Web App:
      - Add edit capability for facilities, leagues, teams, matches
      - Add unscheduled matches to the Matches page
      - Add ability to try to schedule unscheduled matches

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask pyyaml
```

### 3. Copy Files

1. Copy all the Python files (core modules and web modules)
2. Create a `templates` folder
3. Copy all the HTML template files into the `templates` folder

### 4. Run the Application

#### Option A: Simple startup (configure database through web interface)
```bash
python web_app.py
```

#### Option B: Pre-configured startup with database
```bash
python start_tennis_app.py --backend sqlite --db-path tennis.db
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 5. Connect to Database

1. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
2. Enter the path to your tennis database (e.g., `tennis.db`)
3. If you don't have data yet, populate it using:

```bash
python populate_tennis_db.py tennis.db
```

Or load individual data files using the CLI:

```bash
python simple_cli.py --db-path tennis.db load facilities.yaml --execute
python simple_cli.py --db-path tennis.db load leagues.yaml --execute
python simple_cli.py --db-path tennis.db load teams.yaml --execute
python simple_cli.py --db-path tennis.db generate-matches --league-id 1 --execute
```

**CLI Safety Features:**
- All operations default to **dry-run mode** - add `--execute` to perform actual changes
- Preview operations before execution with detailed change descriptions
- Transaction support ensures data integrity

# Execute match generation
python simple_cli.py --db-path tennis.db generate-matches --league-id 1 --execute
```

```bash
# Preview auto-scheduling with quality scores
python simple_cli.py --db-path tennis.db auto-schedule

# Execute auto-scheduling
python simple_cli.py --db-path tennis.db auto-schedule --execute
```

#### **Manual Match Scheduling (Web Interface)**

The web application provides intuitive manual scheduling capabilities for individual matches with visual date selection and conflict detection:

**Interactive Scheduling Process:**
1. **Match Selection**: Navigate to Matches page → Click "Schedule" button on any unscheduled match
2. **Visual Date Browser**: View available dates with quality scores and facility information
3. **Conflict Detection**: See existing matches, court availability, and potential conflicts
4. **Multiple Scheduling Modes**: Choose from same-time, split-time, or custom scheduling
5. **Preview & Confirm**: Preview all changes before committing to database

**Features of Manual Scheduling:**

**Smart Date Recommendations:**
- Dates ranked by quality score (20-100 scale) based on team and league preferences
- Visual indicators for optimal (★), good (★), fair (◉), acceptable (◉), and poor (○) dates
- Real-time conflict detection showing existing matches at each facility
- Court availability display showing available courts per time slot

**Flexible Time Selection:**
- **Same Time Mode**: Select one time slot for all lines (e.g., all 3 lines at 9:00 AM)
- **Split Time Mode**: Select exactly 2 time slots with automatic line distribution
- **Custom Mode**: Individual time selection for each line with maximum flexibility

**Visual Scheduling Interface:**
- Interactive date cards with quality scores, existing matches, and facility constraints
- Color-coded time slots with hover effects and selection indicators
- Real-time validation ensuring proper line distribution and conflict avoidance
- Progress indicators showing match completion status

**Conflict Detection & Validation:**
- Team double-booking prevention (same team can't play multiple matches simultaneously)
- Facility court capacity validation (ensuring sufficient courts available)
- League constraint checking (preferred days, backup days, round timing)
- Warning system for scheduling outside optimal date ranges

**Schedule Preview & Confirmation:**
- Detailed preview showing all database operations before execution
- Conflict and warning display with explanations
- Quality score calculation for the proposed schedule
- Option to cancel or modify before finalizing

**Match Management Actions:**
- **Schedule**: Interactive scheduling with date/time selection
- **Reschedule**: Modify existing scheduled matches with same interface
- **Unschedule**: Remove scheduling while preserving match structure
- **Delete**: Remove matches entirely (unscheduled matches only)

#### **Scheduling Mode Examples**

**Same Time Scheduling** (all lines at one time):
- 3-line match: All lines at 9:00 AM
- Requires facility to have 3+ courts available at 9:00 AM
- Simplest coordination for teams

**Split Time Scheduling** (lines across 2 time slots):
- 3-line match: 2 lines at 9:00 AM, 1 line at 12:00 PM  
- 4-line match: 2 lines at 9:00 AM, 2 lines at 12:00 PM
- Reduces court requirements per time slot
- Allows matches when facilities have limited courts

**Custom Time Scheduling** (maximum flexibility):
- 3-line match: Line 1 at 9:00 AM, Line 2 at 10:30 AM, Line 3 at 1:00 PM
- Each line scheduled independently
- Accommodates complex facility constraints and team preferences

#### **Quality Score Optimization**

The quality scoring system evaluates match scheduling quality on a 20-100 scale by analyzing team preferences, league constraints, and round timing:

**Scoring Algorithm:**
1. **Team Preference Analysis**: Checks if both teams have preferred days and calculates intersection
2. **League Day Matching**: Evaluates against league preferred and backup days
3. **Round Timing Validation**: Determines if the date falls within the appropriate round window
4. **Score Calculation**: Combines team requirements + league preferences + timing compliance

**Quality Score Breakdown:**
- **100**: Optimal - Teams' preferred days within proper round timing
  - Both teams prefer the day AND league prefers the day AND within round window
- **80**: Good - Teams' backup days within round timing  
  - Teams require the day AND league uses as backup AND within round window
- **60**: Fair - League preferred days but outside round timing
  - League prefers the day but scheduling outside the optimal round timeframe
- **40**: Acceptable - League backup days outside round timing
  - League backup day but outside round timing (still schedulable but suboptimal)
- **20**: Poor - Days not preferred by anyone
  - Neither teams nor league prefer this day (last resort scheduling)

**Usage in Scheduling:**
- Auto-scheduling prioritizes higher quality scores when selecting dates
- Manual scheduling displays quality indicators (★ ◉ ○) for visual guidance
- Preview operations show average quality scores for batch scheduling assessment
- "Try Again" functionality seeks improved quality score combinations

#### **Transaction Safety**
- All bulk operations support **dry-run mode** by default
- Preview changes before committing with detailed operation descriptions
- Rollback capability for failed operations
- Conflict detection prevents double-booking teams or facilities

[^round]: A round is completed when every team in a league has played every other team exactly once. For example, in a 6-team league, each round consists of 15 matches (each team plays 5 opponents), and multiple rounds can be configured for extended seasons.
