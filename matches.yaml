# COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES:

# Load matches (both scheduled and unscheduled):
# python sqlite_tennis_db.py --db tennis.db load matches matches.yaml

# List only scheduled matches:
# python sqlite_tennis_db.py --db tennis.db list matches

# List all matches including unscheduled:
# python sqlite_tennis_db.py --db tennis.db list matches --include-unscheduled

# Unschedule a match (removes date/time/facility but keeps the match):
# python sqlite_tennis_db.py --db tennis.db unschedule-match --match-id 2001

# Schedule an unscheduled match:
# python sqlite_tennis_db.py --db tennis.db schedule-match --match-id 2003 --facility-id 1 --date "2025-04-05" --time "10:00"

# NOTES:
# - Unscheduled matches only require: id, league_id, home_team_id, visitor_team_id
# - Scheduled matches require all fields including: facility_id, date, time
# - Partially scheduled matches (missing any of facility/date/time) are treated as unscheduled
# - The system will automatically determine status based on whether all scheduling fields are present
